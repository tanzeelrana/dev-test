/**
 * Route Config
 * ---------------------------
 * This file defines the application's route structure and access control.
 * It provides a central registry for all application routes along with
 * their metadata.
 *
 * To add a new route:
 * 1. Add the path constant to the paths object
 * 2. Add the route metadata to the routes object with the same key
 * 3. Specify accessType: "public" (unauthenticated only),
 *                        "protected" (authenticated only),
 *                        "universal" (both)
 *
 * Example:
 * RoutePaths.SETTINGS = "/settings"
 * Routes.SETTINGS = {
 *   name: "Settings Page",
 *   path: RoutePaths.SETTINGS,
 *   accessType: "protected",
 * }
 *
 * @module routes
